The objective of this analysis is to evaluate Goodcabs' performance across critical metrics such as trip volume, passenger satisfaction, repeat passenger rate, trip distribution, and the balance of new vs. repeat passengers. This will help identify actionable insights to support the 2024 growth and service enhancement goals.

## Recommendations

- <b>Quality of Service</b>: Since GoodCabs employs local drivers, providing them with training and performance-based incentives (e.g., bonuses linked to customer ratings) can improve service quality and boost repeat passenger rates.
- <b>Socioeconomics and Pricing</b>: Offering bikes, cabs, and rickshaws in Tier 2 cities provides a range of options to meet the needs of the large middle-class population, offering flexible pricing and greater convenience, which can enhance customer satisfaction and drive repeat business.
- <b>Building Loyalty for Repeat Business</b>: Personalizing services, offering loyalty programs, and providing amenities like air-conditioning, easy booking, and in-vehicle chargers can improve customer satisfaction and drive higher repeat passenger rates.
